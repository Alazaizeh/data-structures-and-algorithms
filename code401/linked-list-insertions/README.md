# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node, and Create a Linked List class with the given functions

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
 The complexity of the functions increase linearly and in direct proportion to the number of inputs.
- apend: big O(n)
- includes: big O(n)
- toString: big O(n)
- insertBefore: big O(n)
- insertAfter: big O(n)
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->

- apend
     ` Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.`
- includes
     ` Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.`
- toString
     `Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List`
- insertBefore
     `Adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified`
- insertAfter
     `Adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified`
