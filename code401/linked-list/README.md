# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node, and Create a Linked List class

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Big O(n)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->

- insert

     ` Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.`
- includes

     ` Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.`
- toString
     
     `Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List`
