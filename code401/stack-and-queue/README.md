# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node, and Create a Linked List class with the given functions

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
 The complexity of the functions increase linearly and in direct proportion to the number of inputs.
- enqueue: big O(1)
- dequeue: big O(1)
- isEmpty: big O(1)
- peek: big O(1)
- pop: big O(1)
- push : big O(1)


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
- enqueue: big O(1)
- dequeue: big O(1)
- pop: big O(1)
- push : big O(1)
- isEmpty: big O(1)
- peek: big O(1)
