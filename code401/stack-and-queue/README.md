## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
 The complexity of the functions increase linearly and in direct proportion to the number of inputs.
- enqueue: big O(1)
- dequeue: big O(1)
- isEmpty: big O(1)
- peek: big O(1)
- pop: big O(1)
- push : big O(1)


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
- enqueue: big O(1)
- dequeue: big O(1)
- pop: big O(1)
- push : big O(1)
- isEmpty: big O(1)
- peek: big O(1)
