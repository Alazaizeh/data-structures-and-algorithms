## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Big O(log n) becuse it use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(Log n) basically it ignore half of the elements just after one comparison.
